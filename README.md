# dashboard
Repository for home dashboard.



The goal is to create dashboard for home usage that will include the following parts (still in consideration):

Somewhat ready:
1. Bus schedule screen, which will show the arriving busses on the three nearest bus stops and for how long it will take from them to arrive at the stop.
- Files: bus_data_to_database.py, bus_schedule_visualization.py

To do:
2. Outdoor temperature/forecast
3. Indoor temperature/humidity monitor. The values will be measured using Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.


The implementation is made using Python as the language and PostgresSQL as a database.
